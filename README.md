## Features

* **[Briefly list your key features, e.g.]**
    * User Authentication (Sign Up, Log In, Password Reset)
    * Data Management (CRUD operations for your main entities, e.g., "Todos", "Posts", "Items")
    * Realtime Updates with Supabase Subscriptions
    * File Storage (e.g., User Avatars, Project Files)
    * Responsive UI with [Your UI Library, e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Chakra UI]

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * [React](https://react.dev/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    * [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next generation frontend tooling.
    * [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - For declarative routing in React applications.
    * [Optional: Your UI Library (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Chakra UI)] - For styling and UI components.
    * [Optional: State Management (e.g., Zustand, Jotai, React Context)] - For global state management.
* **Backend:**
    * [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - An open-source Firebase alternative providing:
        * PostgreSQL Database
        * Authentication (OAuth, Email/Password)
        * Realtime Subscriptions
        * Storage
        * Edge Functions
* **Development Tools:**
    * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) & [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)) - JavaScript runtime and package manager.
    * [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or higher recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* A code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
* A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)

### Supabase Setup

1.  **Create a Supabase Project:**
    * Go to [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/) and create a new project.
    * Choose a region close to your users for better performance.
2.  **Get your API Keys:**
    * Once your project is created, navigate to `Project Settings` > `API`.
    * You'll need your `Project URL` and `anon public` key.
3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (`./.env`).
    * Add your Supabase credentials:
        ```env
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY"
        ```
        *Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL` and `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY` with your actual keys.*
4.  **Database Schema (Optional but Recommended):**
    * If your project relies on specific tables, you'll need to create them in your Supabase project. You can use the Supabase Studio's SQL Editor or Table Editor.
    * **[Example SQL for a simple 'todos' table]:**
        ```sql
        -- Create a table for public profiles
        create table todos (
          id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
          user_id uuid references auth.users(id) not null,
          task text check (char_length(task) > 0) not null,
          is_complete boolean default false,
          inserted_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
        );

        -- Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
        alter table todos enable row security;

        -- Allow authenticated users to view their own todos
        create policy "Users can view their own todos" on todos for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);

        -- Allow authenticated users to insert todos
        create policy "Users can insert their own todos" on todos for insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

        -- Allow authenticated users to update their own todos
        create policy "Users can update their own todos" on todos for update using (auth.uid() = user_id);

        -- Allow authenticated users to delete their own todos
        create policy "Users can delete their own todos" on todos for delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);
        ```
        *Adapt this SQL to your project's needs.*

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
